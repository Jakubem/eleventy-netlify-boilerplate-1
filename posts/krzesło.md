DNA profiling is often referred to as **DNA fingerprinting**. Fingerprints are well known to be unique to each person. Most countries scan the fingerprints of visitors to generate a unique identifier, and many mobile phones use fingerprints as a quick biometric password.

A fingerprint is an arrangement of ridges and valleys that develops before birth and is a pseudo-random function of the exact activity, orientation, and movements of the fetus. Millions of cells make up the fingerprint, and their relative arrangement persists throughout a person's life. Fingerprint scanners don't capture a complete dataset of the arrangement of each of these cells, that's far more information than is necessary.

Instead, they usually capture a fingerprint as an image which is divided into 400 non-overlapping sites. Rare features on the ridges including islands, crossovers, spurs, and bifurcations are identified and assigned one of four directions based on their orientation, while all other sites are ignored. A sample fingerprint is considered a match if the rare feature sites (usually 10) have matching orientations and types.
